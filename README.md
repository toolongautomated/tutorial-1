# Tutorial #1: one branch to rule them all

![tl;a banenr](docs/banner.jpeg)

ðŸ““ Code in this repository is a supplementary material to the following series
on the `too long; automated` blog: [one branch to rule them
all](https://toolongautomated.com/posts/2024/one-branch-to-rule-them-all-1).

## Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to:
- develop your code in a simple git flow, based on a [permissive trunk-based
    branching strategy](https://www.toolongautomated.com/posts/2024/one-branch-to-rule-them-all-1.html#option-2-permissive-trunk-based-development)
- version an application using git tags and Docker image tags
- build and push Docker images
- deploy the application to Cloud Run (staging and production environments)
- configure deployments using `.env` files
- `ðŸš€ tl; a`: automate tagging, building and pushing Docker images,
    deploying the application to Cloud Run (read more about the available
    GitHub Actions workflows [here](.github/workflows/README.md))

If you'd like to implement the tutorial step-by-step, several git tags are here,
marking important milestones. Use `git checkout [TAG]` to explore the code
locally, or click on the link in the list below to see it in GitHub's UI:

## Prerequisites

- `docker` >= 27.2.0
- `python` >= 3.10.4

## How to run locally

`app/src` directory contains a simple Flask server that prints a welcome
message.

First, install the requirements:

```shell
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, run the application:

```shell
cd app/src
export FLASK_APP=main.py
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:80 main:app
```

Finally, go to `http://0.0.0.0:80` in your browser. You should see the welcome text:

### Tests

`app/test` directory contains unit and integration tests.

To run the tests, first install the requirements:

```shell
cd app
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

Then, run the **unit tests**:

```shell
cd app/
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)
pytest test/unit -v
```

Or the **integration tests**:

```shell
cd app/
pytest test/integration -v
```

Note that integration tests require the `ENDPOINT_URL` environment variable to
be set. This should point to the URL of the application running in Cloud Run.

## Application versioning

The application is versioned using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
approach. Whenever application-related files are added/removed/changed, a new
version should should be added to the [CHANGELOG](app/CHANGELOG.md).

## Recommended git flow

To add a new feature, follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch from the `main` branch.
1. Add the new feature to the application.
1. Add a new entry to the [CHANGELOG](app/CHANGELOG.md).
1. Open a PR to the `main` branch.
1. Once approved, merge the code.
1. `ðŸš€ tl; a`:
   1. git tag will be created automatically
   1. Docker image will be built and pushed to the registry of your choice
      (Docker Hub in this tutorial)

If you'd like to learn how to perform steps from point 6 manually, here you are:
- [git tagging](https://www.toolongautomated.com/posts/2024/one-branch-to-rule-them-all-2.html#git-tagging)
- [build and push Docker images](https://www.toolongautomated.com/posts/2024/one-branch-to-rule-them-all-2.html#containerize-the-application)
- [configure `gcloud` CLI](https://www.toolongautomated.com/posts/2025/one-branch-to-rule-them-all-3.html#configure-gcloud-cli)
- [deploy to Cloud Run](https://www.toolongautomated.com/posts/2025/one-branch-to-rule-them-all-3.html#deploy-to-cloud-run)

Once the code is merged and the Docker image gets built, you can continue to
deploy a new version of the application:

1. Create a new branch from the `main` branch.
1. Update the `.env` file for the environment you'd like to deploy to.
1. Open a PR to the `main` branch.
1. `ðŸš€ tl; a`:
    1. Test environment will be deployed to Cloud Run.
    1. Integration tests will be executed.
    1. Results will be reported to the PR.
1. If the tests pass, it will be possible to merge the PR.
1. `ðŸš€ tl; a`: once merged into `main`, the affected Cloud Run environment will
    be updated.
